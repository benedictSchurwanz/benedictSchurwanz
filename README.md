# Hi there! 👋

- 🔭 I’ve been working on a fun project - [Boatfight!](https://github.com/benedictSchurwanz/boatfight) - a Battleship game (without infringing copyrights, of course). It's an interesting way to explore a new language or framework, and I can try to think of new ways to write the AI. My last shot at it was [Boat Attack](https://github.com/benedictSchurwanz/boatattack).
