# Hi there! 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a fun project I've done a couple times before: a Battleship game (without infringing copyrights, of course). It's an interesting way to explore a new language or framework, and I can try to think of new ways to write the AI. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the latest updates to Ruby on Rails, a bit of Python, and diving deeper into JavaScript and React. There is always more to learn, _especially_ when you _think_ you know something really well.

- 👯 It would be fun to collaborate on side projects or open source projects. I always like seeing different developers' perspectives. 

- 😄 Pronouns: He/him. It is important to me to treat all different people with respect. 

- ⚡ Favorite emoji: 🤔  ...  Most often used emoji: 😁
